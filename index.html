          <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Duston and I am here to make your life a little bit easier. Coming from an educational background in mathematics, writing beautiful code is something that sorta comes natural to me. From customly coded sites like this one, to blogs using wordpress or wix, whatever your brand needs I am confident to deliver. Doing my absolute best, I will work with you step-by-step to personify who you are through your webpage while keeping your code clean and readable for any future advancements. I really look forward to hearing from you and be sure to checkout my previous work down below.</p>
